        <p style="margin-top: 1%;">JavaScript (abbreviated as JS), is a interpreted, high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
            This language is also characterized as weakly typed, dynamic, multi-paradigm and prototype-based .</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1%;">Here are some interesting facts about javascript:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li >Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
                 A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is single threaded. 
                This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective standard libraries and syntax, 
                these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.</li>
